# Tradeoffs: SWIFT / ISO20022 Correspondent Banking

## Strengths

- Widest global reach and bank interoperability
- Mature compliance expectations and auditability
- Supports high-value cross-border transfers

## Weaknesses / risks

- De-risking / correspondent withdrawal risk (jurisdictional risk perception)
- Slower settlement and higher fees than domestic rails
- Data sharing across borders is sensitive (must align with privacy rules)

## Best when

- You need integration with legacy banking system and global counterparties
- You can satisfy stringent AML/CFT and sanctions standards
- You can maintain strong governance and transparency

## Required attestations rationale

- Banks require KYB/KYC + BO verification
- Sanctions screening is non-negotiable
- License validity and ongoing reporting reduces perceived risk
