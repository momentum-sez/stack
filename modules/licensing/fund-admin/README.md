# Fund Administrator License Module (Scaffold)

This is a **stub scaffold** that provides:

- application schema + example
- OPA rules for eligibility and ongoing checks
- periodic reporting + incident reporting schemas
- policy-to-code map linking obligations to attestations

Deployments MUST adapt this scaffold to local law and supervisory practices.
