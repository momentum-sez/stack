# Provenance and IP (normative)

To ensure the stack remains open and redistributable:

- Each module SHOULD include a provenance file describing sources and licenses.
- Build tooling SHOULD refuse to publish artifacts that are not redistributable without explicit rights.

Recommended file:

- `sources/provenance.yaml`
