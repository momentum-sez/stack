# Tradeoffs: Stablecoin Settlement

## Strengths

- Faster settlement, potentially lower cost
- Operates continuously (24/7) depending on network
- Can improve accessibility where correspondent networks are thin

## Weaknesses / risks

- Regulatory classification varies by jurisdiction (securities/payment instrument/commodity)
- Requires strong controls for wallet risk, travel rule, and sanctions address screening
- Reserve transparency and redemption rights must be credible (issuer risk)

## Best when

- Participants can operate under a clear virtual asset / stablecoin regime
- The corridor is targeted at specific corridors or communities (not universal)
- You can provide reserve attestations and strong compliance proofs

## Required attestations rationale

- Stablecoin issuer + intermediaries must be licensed/authorized
- Reserves/solvency and safeguarding proofs reduce counterparty risk
- Travel rule readiness reduces compliance friction for VASP-like activities
