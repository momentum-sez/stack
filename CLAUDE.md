## NON-NEGOTIABLE: No destructive git — ever

Applies across every Mass / Momentum / Moxie repo
(moxie, moxie-whitepaper, moxie/web, kernel, kernel worktrees, centcom, stack, lex,
gstore, momentum, momentum-dev, momentum-research, momentum-docs, mass-webapp,
mass-bom, api-gateway, attestation-engine, templating-engine, starters,
organization-info, investment-info, treasury-info, identity-info, consent-info,
governance-info, institutional-world-model-whitepaper,
programmable-institutions-whitepaper, and every other Mass/Momentum/Moxie repo).

**Forbidden commands (non-exhaustive):**

- `git commit` from a subagent (main thread commits only — subagents stage only)
- `git push` in any form, any branch (main thread pushes only)
- `git reset --hard`, `git reset --keep`, or any `git reset` that moves HEAD
- `git checkout` of a shared checkout, `git switch`, `git restore`
- `git stash` in any form (including `pop`, `drop`, `apply`, `clear`)
- `git clean` in any form (`-f`, `-fd`, `-x`, …)
- `git rebase` in any form (including interactive)
- `git branch -D`, `git branch --delete --force`
- `git worktree remove --force`
- `git update-ref`, `git filter-branch`, `git filter-repo`
- `rm -rf` on anything git-tracked

**Required:**

- Agents stage changes only (`git add <path>`). The main thread alone commits and pushes.
- Parallel work uses `git worktree add <unique-path> -b <unique-branch> origin/<base>` and operates inside that isolated path. Never mutate the shared checkout's HEAD.
- Merge conflicts are resolved via merge commits — never via `reset`, `stash`, or `checkout`.
- If a destructive op seems necessary, STOP and escalate to the user. Do not proceed.

**Additive alternatives (always safe):** `git worktree add`, `git revert <commit>`,
`git diff > patch.diff`, `git merge` (no-ff or default), `git fetch`.

This rule survives context compression. Every agent spawned in this repo inherits it.

**Incident reference:** 2026-04-16, Agent 5 (conservation invariants) ran
`git reset --hard --no-recurse-submodules` inside its isolated worktree despite a
"DO NOT commit. Stage only." instruction. The prompt failed to enumerate the
forbidden-command list verbatim. Lesson: the list above must be pasted into every
agent prompt — no paraphrasing, no abbreviation.

## NON-NEGOTIABLE: Multi-agent concurrency via worktrees

Many local agents run against this repo simultaneously from a single main thread.
They MUST share the repo without destructive interaction. The only safe model:

**Every non-trivial agent operates in its own git worktree:**

```
git worktree add <unique-path> -b <unique-branch> origin/<base-branch>
cd <unique-path>
# ... do work, stage changes ...
# main thread reviews, merges (merge commit only), pushes
```

- `<unique-path>` must be unique per agent (e.g. `/tmp/agent-<id>` or a path that embeds a UUID/task-id). Never reuse paths across agents.
- `<unique-branch>` must be unique per agent (e.g. `agent/<task-id>` or `frontier/<name>-<short-sha>`). Never reuse branch names.
- `<base-branch>` is whatever the user has checked out on main thread (typically `develop` or `main`).

**Rules for concurrent agents:**

1. An agent operates ONLY inside its own worktree path. Never `cd` out of it into the shared checkout. Never read/write files in the shared checkout (that path belongs to the main thread and possibly other agents).
2. An agent never touches HEAD of the shared checkout. No `git checkout`, `git switch`, `git reset`, `git rebase` anywhere.
3. An agent never mutates another agent's worktree or branch.
4. An agent stages changes inside its worktree (`git add`). It does NOT commit. The main thread commits after reviewing the staged changes (agents cannot reliably write good commit messages under a shared history, and commits from parallel agents race on the branch ref).
5. An agent never pushes. Only the main thread pushes.
6. When an agent finishes, its worktree and branch stay until the main thread merges or the user explicitly authorizes cleanup. Do NOT `git worktree remove` your own worktree on exit — the harness cleans up when appropriate.
7. If an agent hits a conflict with another agent's work, it reports the conflict to the main thread and stops. It does NOT resolve the conflict via reset/checkout/stash.
8. If an agent needs to read another repo (cross-repo context), it reads files directly (Read tool) — it does NOT `git checkout` or `git worktree add` in a repo it is not assigned to.

**Read-only agents** (audit, explore, documentation search) may operate in the shared checkout without worktree isolation, because they do not write. They still never run any git command that mutates state.

**File-locking guidance for agents sharing the main checkout (read-only only):**

- Use Read, Grep, Glob freely.
- Do NOT use Edit, Write, or Bash commands that write files in the shared checkout.
- If you find something that needs a write, report it — don't write.

**If any of the above becomes infeasible, STOP and escalate to the user.**
Never silently break the concurrency invariant.

Mass Protocol EZ Stack — the open-source zone operator kit (Apache-2.0). See
`~/centcom/CLAUDE.md` for ecosystem context and `~/kernel/CLAUDE.md` for the
proprietary companion.

## Canonical design sources

The Mass architecture is specified across five standalone documents at repository
roots. A stack contributor building a zone-operator artifact should read the
kernel document first and follow pointers as needed:

- `~/kernel/SUPREMUM.md` — kernel design (multi-harbored entity, 23-domain
  compliance tensor, corridor protocol, proof-producing execution).
- `~/op/SUPREMUM.md` — Op as a standalone typed bytecode. Stack deployments
  execute Op programs through the kernel's SAVM.
- `~/lex/SUPREMUM.md` — Lex as a standalone dependently-typed logic for
  jurisdictional compliance rules. Lex rules compile to Op.
- `~/centcom/SUPREMUM.md` — ecosystem design: repo topology, canonical
  vocabulary, seven-paper research roadmap, multi-harbor network effect.
- `~/momentum-research/SUPREMUM-ADDENDUM.md` — cross-paper integration note
  across the seven-paper programme.

Kernel-implementation architecture notes live at
`~/kernel/docs/architecture/SUPREMUM/` — internal engineering detail, not
external spec. When stack artifacts reference architecture, cite the root
canonical `SUPREMUM.md` files above rather than the internal notes directory.
