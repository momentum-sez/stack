# v0.4.26 — Artifact graph edges + witness bundles

This patch extends the **artifact graph closure verifier** introduced in v0.4.25 with two production-hardening capabilities:

1) a **machine-readable edge list** (so closure graphs can be analyzed programmatically), and
2) a **portable witness bundle format** (so closures can be moved between environments without copying an entire repo).

## Added

### `--emit-edges`

`msez artifact graph verify` now accepts `--emit-edges`.

When enabled, the `MSEZArtifactGraphVerifyReport` includes an `edges[]` array of `{"from","to","label","depth","source"}` entries.

This makes the closure report usable for:

- DAG analysis (depth, fanout, hot spots)
- dependency visualization
- automated completeness audits

### `--bundle <zip>`

`msez artifact graph verify` now accepts `--bundle <path.zip>`.

When specified, the command emits a **witness bundle** containing:

- `manifest.json` — the full graph verify report
- `README.txt` — extraction + verification hints
- `artifacts/<type>/<filename>` — every resolved node in the closure
- `root/<filename>` — the original root file when the report root is `--path <file>`

The bundle is **content-addressed by construction** (filenames retain digest prefixes), but is not authoritative; verifiers should still run `--strict` against extracted artifacts.

### `--bundle-max-bytes`

Optional safety guard: cap total included bytes in the witness bundle (0 = unlimited). Excluded entries are recorded under `bundle.excluded[]` in the emitted report.

## Tests

- Added `tests/test_artifact_graph_witness_bundle.py` covering:
  - `--emit-edges` edge list emission
  - `--bundle` witness bundle creation + expected zip contents
