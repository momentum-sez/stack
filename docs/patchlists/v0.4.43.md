# PHOENIX v0.4.43 ASCENSION Patchlist

## Release Summary

Version 0.4.43 transforms the MSEZ Stack into a Smart Asset Operating System with comprehensive security hardening, a novel virtual machine for decentralized network interaction, and defense-in-depth protection.

## New Modules

### Smart Asset VM (`tools/phoenix/vm.py`)
Stack-based execution environment with 256-bit words, compliance coprocessor, migration coprocessor, 60+ opcodes across 10 instruction categories, and gas metering for DoS prevention.

### Security Layer (`tools/phoenix/security.py`)
Defense-in-depth protection including scoped attestations for replay prevention, versioned state with compare-and-swap for TOCTOU protection, time-locked operations for front-running prevention, and tamper-evident audit logging.

### Hardening Layer (`tools/phoenix/hardening.py`)
Production-grade utilities including comprehensive input validators, thread-safe collections, atomic counters, and economic attack guards with 10x collateral limits.

## Enhancements

### Compliance Coprocessor Integration
The Smart Asset VM now provides direct access to the Compliance Tensor through TENSOR_GET, TENSOR_SET, TENSOR_EVAL, and TENSOR_COMMIT opcodes.

### Migration Coprocessor Integration
The Smart Asset VM provides migration protocol access through LOCK, UNLOCK, TRANSIT_BEGIN, TRANSIT_END, SETTLE, and COMPENSATE opcodes.

### Attestation Scope Binding
Attestations are now bound to specific (asset, jurisdiction, domain) tuples with cryptographic commitment, preventing replay attacks across different contexts.

### Time-Locked Withdrawals
Withdrawal operations now require a 7-day time lock with commit-delay-reveal pattern, preventing front-running attacks.

## Security Fixes

### Replay Attack Prevention
Added NonceRegistry with automatic expiration to prevent replay of valid messages in new contexts.

### TOCTOU Protection
Added VersionedStore with compare-and-swap operations to prevent time-of-check-to-time-of-use vulnerabilities.

### Economic Attack Guards
Added EconomicGuard enforcing 10x collateral limits on attestations, minimum bond requirements, and whale concentration detection.

## Test Coverage
