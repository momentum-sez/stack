# Licensing

Recommended split:

- **Code** (tools, schemas, OpenAPI, policy-as-code): Apache-2.0
- **Documentation / model texts**: CC-BY-4.0 (or CC-BY-SA-4.0 if you want share-alike)

Each module declares its license in `module.yaml`.
Third-party legal texts must NOT be included unless you have redistribution rights.
