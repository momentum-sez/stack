  "status": "PENDING",
  "reason": "The Python cryptography module is not available in this environment (cffi backend issue). The lockfile fixture must be generated in an environment with working tools/mez.py.",

    "cd /home/user/stack",

  "notes": "The Rust mez-pack crate implements lockfile generation via Lawpack, Regpack, and Licensepack. The cross-language lockfile test validates that the Rust lockfile digest computation matches the Python lawpack.py:_compute_lawpack_digest_from_zip() output. For now, the Rust test verifies the lockfile determinism property (same input -> same lockfile) and the digest computation mechanics.",
