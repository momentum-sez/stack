# Tradeoffs: Open Banking / Account-to-Account (A2A)

## Strengths

- Uses domestic payment rails; can be low-cost and fast
- Enables programmable payment initiation and account information
- Strong consumer-consent model when implemented correctly

## Weaknesses / risks

- Coverage depends on domestic open banking maturity and API availability
- API security and consent management must be robust
- Cross-border portability is limited (domestic-first)

## Best when

- Your priority is deep domestic integration and SME payments
- There is a credible legal basis for data sharing and consent
- Banks support API access and developer onboarding

## Required attestations rationale

- Consent proof is core to open-banking legitimacy
- API security baseline and incident reporting is required
- KYB/KYC still required depending on payment initiation role
