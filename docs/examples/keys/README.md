# Example keys (development only)

These keys are **development fixtures** for demonstrating the `mez vc sign/verify` commands.

- DO NOT use these keys in production.
- Real deployments MUST generate their own keys, publish trust anchors, and rotate keys per corridor policy.

Included fixtures:

- `dev.ed25519.jwk` — generic single-signer key
- `zone-a.ed25519.jwk` — example zone authority A
- `zone-b.ed25519.jwk` — example zone authority B
