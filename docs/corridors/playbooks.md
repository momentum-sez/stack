# Corridor playbooks

Playbooks are **operator-facing** runbooks for corridor activation.

They cover:

- legal agreements
- compliance eligibility and attestations
- technical onboarding and testing
- operating model, monitoring and reporting
- incident and de-risking procedures

Each corridor module includes its own playbook under `modules/corridors/<name>/docs/playbook.md`.
