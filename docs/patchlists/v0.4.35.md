# Patchlist — v0.4.35

Summary: **portable audit packets for Smart Assets** by extending witness bundles to support **directory roots** and adding a one-shot **asset module witness-bundle** command.

## Main changes

- **Artifact graph roots can now be directories.** `mez artifact graph verify --path <dir>` scans all structured files (JSON/YAML) under the directory for embedded `ArtifactRef`s and resolves the full closure (with the same strict-digest option as before).
- **Witness bundles now support directory roots.** When the closure root is a directory, the bundle includes the scanned structured root files under `root/<dirname>/...` in addition to `manifest.json` and `artifacts/...`.
- **Operator UX: `mez asset module witness-bundle`.** A convenience wrapper that emits a portable audit packet for an asset module directory (receipts/checkpoints/proofs + referenced artifacts), suitable for air-gapped review and dispute workflows.
